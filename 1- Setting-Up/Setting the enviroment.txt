1) To start learning django first we should have python installed in our system.
2) If python is already installed then its good to go and if not then go to 'https://www.python.org/downloads/' and download for your system.
3) After that , create the repository/ folder where we want our django project.
4) After creating folder need to create a virtual enviroment, so that all the packages we will install during our project will remain inside that folder only.
5) For creating virtual enviroment open command prompt.
6) We can create virtual enviroment by 2 method :-
          a) - using command 'python -m venv venv'
          b) pip install virtualenv
7) After this a folder named 'venv' will be created in your folder.
8) To use the virtual enviroment , we need to activate it by using command 'venv\Scripts\activate' (for method a).
9) If run successfully venv will wriiten before the path in cmd.
10) Then we can install django by using command , 'pip install django'.
11) After that we can check if django is installed by checking its version.
